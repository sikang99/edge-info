## glTF

A glTF (GL Transmission Format) DRC (Digital Rights Committee) viewer is a software tool that allows you to view 3D models stored in the glTF file format, which is a file format for 3D graphics that is used by many 3D applications. The DRC component refers to a specific subset of the glTF specification that is used to define 3D models that can be used in the context of the Digital Rights Committee, which is a group that develops and maintains standards for digital content.

There are several glTF DRC viewers available, both as standalone applications and as plug-ins for other software tools. Some examples of glTF DRC viewers include:

- Cesium: An open-source 3D globe and map platform that includes a built-in glTF DRC viewer.
- glTF Viewer: A simple, lightweight glTF DRC viewer that is available as a Chrome extension.
- Babylon.js: A popular open-source JavaScript library for building 3D games and applications that includes a glTF DRC viewer.
- Sketchfab: A platform for sharing and viewing 3D models that supports glTF DRC files.

To use a glTF DRC viewer, you will typically need to have the necessary software installed on your computer and then open the glTF DRC file in the viewer. The viewer will then display the 3D model, allowing you to rotate, zoom, and otherwise interact with it. Some viewers may also offer additional features such as the ability to edit the model or to apply materials or textures to it.
